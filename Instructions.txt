Please create a responsive web page based off the coding-challenge-mock-up.jpg design. In the hero section, there is a Learn More button that should open a youtube video modal on click to play a youtube video. The mock up doesn't have a design for the modal so please improvise. All the image assets you need are in the zip file. 

Please use the following instructions.

1. Use only html, css, javascript, and jquery. Do not use react, vue, svelt, or angular.
2. Clicking on the "Learn More" button in the hero should open a modal that plays a youtube video. There is no design for the modal so please improvise as you see fit.
3. Feel free to use Youtube API for the video functionality.
4. Below 768px, the web page should go into mobile view where the two cards (text/image) should stack on top of each other. 
5. Font Family for the text can be Arial.

How to deliver your final result

1. Zip file containing an index.html file with your css, javascript, and image files
2. Upload project onto your own web hosting platform of choice (netlify, vercel, github, etc) and provide a link.
